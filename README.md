# Mapping_Earthquakes
Mapping earthquake data using Javascript with the D3 and Leaflet libraries to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to create an interactive web page to display earthquake data gathered from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) in GeoJSON form. With the use of Javascript, Leaflet and Mapbox, we were able to display earthquake magnitudes and locations throughout the world on various map layers. When visiting the web page, users are able to interact in the following ways:
- Select between three different map layers - Street view, Satellite view and Dark mode
- Select three different data layers - all earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 4.5
- Select a circle on the map to display that earthquake's location and magnitude
